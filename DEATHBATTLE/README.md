# DEATHBATTLE
Have you ever wondered which superhero would prevail in the ultimate death battle? For this project, we wanted to create an interactive website where users can select characters from both the Marvel and DC universes and be able to view their skills side by side. Our stick figure image of the characters are sized dynamically based off of the character height. The radar chart will display the characters' skill set and how powerful they are based off of data returned from an API call to SuperHeroDB. The user can then make both characters fight to the death and an overall winner will be determined.

**This project was done using HTML, JavaScript, CSS. We also created our own API that returns all of the hero information from a SuperHero Database.

In order to view our website, please use the following link:
